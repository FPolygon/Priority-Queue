# Priority-Queue
This file contains the implementation of a priority queue class template. The priority queue is implemented using a custom binary search tree (BST). Each node in the BST contains a priority value and a corresponding value. The priority queue supports insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements based on their priority. Duplicate priorities are also supported, and the priority queue maintains the order of elements with the same priority using a linked list. The class provides various member functions such as enqueue, dequeue, clear, begin, next, size, toString, and peek. The priority queue is implemented as a template, allowing it to store elements of any type. This file also includes necessary header files, such as iostream, sstream, and set, and provides a default constructor, destructor, and assignment operator for the priority queue class. The code is a part of the CS 251 Spring 2023 course at the University of Illinois Chicago.
